### 2.2 Payment Calculation Formula

#### For Revenue Share Model:

```
Client Project Value: ₹50,000
Company Margin: 40%
Your Share: 60%

Your Payment = ₹50,000 × 60% = ₹30,000
Company Retains = ₹50,000 × 40% = ₹20,000
```

#### For Hourly Model:

```
Hours Worked: 40 hours
Hourly Rate: ₹500/hour

Your Payment = 40 × ₹500 = ₹20,000
Less TDS (10%): ₹2,000
